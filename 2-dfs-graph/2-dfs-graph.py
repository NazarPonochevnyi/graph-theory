Comments:
In the 2-dfs-graph.in file, enter the links between the graph nodes in the
form: node1 space node2. In the last line enter the name of the nodes, the
connection between which you want to check, in the form: node1 space node2.
Run the 2-dfs-graph.py file. In the file 2-dfs-graph.out, you will find the
number 1 if the connection is possible, else you will find the number 0.
